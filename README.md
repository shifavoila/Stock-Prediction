# The project is about forecasting and predicting the stocks of Microsoft for over a long term period on a micro scale (per day stock price). As we can see in the final plot that the stocks are actually going up over a period of time which means that its a good stock to buy.

# In this model we used Sequential model from tensorflow to specify a neural network, precisely, sequential from input to output, passing through a series of neural layers, one after the other where the activation function we used is 'relu' and it is optimized using Adam Optimizer.
